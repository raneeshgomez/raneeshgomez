I am a Software Engineer who is excited about creating avenues to 
elevate humanity through technology. I am passionate about Full-Stack 
Web Development, with a special interest in API Design. Some technologies

graduate from the University of Westminster, UK with a BEng (Hons) 
Software Engineering degree with First Class Honours.

In my free time I perform as a vocalist and beatboxer in Harmonic.Distortion
